- binary SMO - colon cancer 

- further improve : 
   -ANOVA to reduce feature size
   -detect stagnation , inject changes -- restrict no of features (eg, less than 50)( enhancement) 
   -have diffrent combo and compare 


- find diff with work and others , binary optimizations
- demo(show comparisions on results , showcase runs )

-novelty , explain well , have knowledge 

-report writing 

-ppt compare
